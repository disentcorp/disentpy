Welcome to the main page for the Disent client library. Currently supports Python3.8.x+. Docs presume familiary with basic python, pandas, numpy, and derivatives ðŸ¤‘.

Quickstart
==================

.. _link: https://pypi.org/project/disentpy/

Available on PyPi (`link`_) via :code:`pip`.

.. code-block:: console

   (venv) $ pip install disentpy

.. code-block:: python3

   >>> import disent
   >>> disent.example()

   [720 rows x 6 columns]

When using :code:`disent.example()` you'll get a :code:`pandas.DataFrame` showing a modeled equity volatlity surface derived from public domain AAPL options chains. This is a wrapper on :ref:`disent.hub() <hub>`.

First time users will prompted for a key:

.. code-block:: python3

   >>> disent.example()

Tutorials
==================

The following walkthroughs will give users a flavor of Disent's API capabilities and built in analytics.

Market Data Retrieval
--------------------------

**Use case** "I'm a technologist at an asset manager, how can I pull modeled data out of Disent?"

.. Observable market quotes
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. *(todo)*

.. Fully inverted surface (black implied)
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. *(todo)*

.. Normalized OTC surface
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _hub:

When using :code:`disent.hub()` you'll get a :code:`pandas.DataFrame`:

.. code:: python3

   >>> model="DEMO_EQD_VOLS"
   >>> ticker = 'AAPL'
   >>> model_args = {'ticker':ticker}
   >>> df = disent.hub(model,model_args)
   >>> df

.. note::
   
   Various configurations and settings are available for enterprise subscribers. Below is describing the specifics of the **DEMO_EQD_VOLS** default model.

*Descriptive columns*

.. _OCC: https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Directory-of-Listed-Products
  
- :math:`\text{TCK}s` are the option contract root symbols using standard exchange root codes (`OCC`_) root symbols.

- :math:`\text{MNY}s` are defined as :math:`f(S,K) = \displaystyle\frac{K}{S}` bucketed into a pre-defined moneyness scale.

- :math:`\text{T}s` are rolling contract maturities, i.e. durations/tenors/time periods (akin to :code:`datetime.timedelta`), bucketed into a classic tenor scale:

.. list-table::
   :align: center

   * - 1M
     - 3M
     - 6M
     - 1Y
     - 5Y
     - 10Y

Across the Disent platform rolling tenors include two helpers:

.. _ISO8601: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601

- :math:`\text{DT}s` are expressed as `ISO8601`_ strings as :math:`\text{ACT}` days from today (:math:`t_0`). Use :code:`pandas.to_datetime()` for conversion. :math:`\text{ACT}` is :math:`[t_0+T]`

.. _convention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention

- :math:`\text{YRS}s` are the year fractions from today and :math:`\text{DT}` using :math:`\text{ACT/365 Fixed}` `convention`_.


*Evalauted columns*

.. _Black-Scholes-Merton: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model
.. _spline-based interpolation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation

- :math:`\text{IV}s` is the implied volatlity. It is derived using a Disent-specific implementation of `Black-Scholes-Merton`_ using `spline-based interpolation`_.
